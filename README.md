Inspiration
The inspiration for our panic detection app arises from personal experiences and a profound awareness of the impact of panic attacks. We have witnessed the distress and helplessness that come with these episodes, which motivates us to provide a supportive solution. As mental health awareness grows, we see an opportunity to leverage wearable technology, such as smartwatches, to empower individuals in managing panic attacks, thereby reducing their social and emotional burdens. Our ultimate aim is to positively impact the lives of those affected by panic attacks, offering early detection, support, and peace of mind.

What it does
The proposed solution we have come up with is whenever the user has a panic attack, our AI detects it and sends an alert message to the person's family member or close friend. We plan to include features such as guided meditations or minigames which help calm the mind.

Achievements
We managed to achieve an accuracy of 91.1% with our AI model and a precisely curated dataset. We detect panic attacks by using the heart rate from the watch and calculating the heart rate variability before passing these values to our AI model.

Panic Detection App for Smartwatches
Description
Our innovative app leverages the power of smartwatches to detect and respond to panic attacks. We understand the distressing nature of panic attacks and their impact on individuals' lives. Our solution is designed to provide real-time monitoring and support.
